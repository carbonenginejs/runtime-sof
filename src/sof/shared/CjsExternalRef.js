 * CarbonEngineJS-original external document reference.

 * Carbon ships deferred-loading nodes for children (EveChildRef) and
 * controllers (Tr2ControllerReference) but inline-loads everything else
 * because its blocking BeResMan made that free. For slots with no Carbon
 * reference class - currently the model rotation/translation curves - the
 * builder emits this node instead: the authored res path plus the interface
 * the loaded root must implement. A consuming loader resolves the reference
 * by fetching and decoding the target document, verifying the root against
 * `expects`, and splicing it into the owning slot.
